Have you ever wanted to take amazing photos but donâ€™t know where to go to take them?
We have the solution for you.
We wanted to build an innovative app for the creatives who love to take aesthetic photos but did not know where the prime locations were.
Shutter allows users to build a community where they can discover pins around London, explore hashtags you are interested in, run location searches, share your own photos and view other pins on a map.

<!-- Tech Stack -->

## Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - Used as the Javascript framework of choice for the project. Handles the views logic of the project.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
  - The database technology used.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - The technology used to handle the backend including authentication and other database requests.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - The featured NodeJS Web Framework.
- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
  - Used within the JSX components in React.
- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/CSS3)
  - Used for the overall look of the site and its elements.

* APIs :
  - Google Maps API
  * [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com)
    - Used to handle the api requests for the main map page on the site.
  * [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com)
    - Image hosting that we integrated with MongoDB.
  * [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)
    - Dynamic randomized images used for the sign up and login pages.

<!-- Challenges -->

## Challenges

- One of the hardest parts was getting the api to generate for the user entry upon creation of posts. We found that the google maps api wasn't the best for visual changes so then integrated the MapBox api with it for getting a clean UI.
- Combining MongoDB with the Cloudinary image upload was tricky to handle the post requests.
- Using Passport to handle the auth and React's useContext hook was a new technology we hadn't handled before.
