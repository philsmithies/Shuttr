# shuttr ðŸ“¸

Have you ever wanted to take amazing photos but donâ€™t know where to go to take them?
We have the solution for you.
We wanted to build an innovative app for the creatives who love to take aesthetic photos but did not know where the prime locations were.
Shutter allows users to build a community where they can discover pins around London, explore hashtags you are interested in, run location searches, share your own photos and view other pins on a map.
